# Cloud to containers to serverless
The evolution of computing infrastructure is rapid, from cloud, to containers to serverless technologies. Cloud computing has become the leading option for hosting computing needs, offering benefits like faster time to market, greater scalability, and higher availability. Containers, such as Docker, enable isolated process spaces with lower overhead and have experienced rapid growth. Developers appreciate the ease of packaging applications and dependencies in containers. Serverless computing, including AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions, is a newer option that provisions and deprovisions applications on-demand, eliminating the need for long-running virtual machines. This field is experiencing rapid change, with each new innovation shaping the way computing is approached.

# The rugged frontier of DevOps: Security
The integration of security into DevOps is crucial, but it presents challenges due to historical undervaluation and different priorities. The Rugged Manifesto offers aspirational values for a better defense approach. Deputising a security champion in each group can help overcome the understaffing problem. Infrastructure as code and continuous delivery pipelines can aid compliance auditors and enable security testing from the left. Four key areas for security testing in CI/CD systems are software supply chain security, regression testing, environment validation, and attack testing. Instrumenting runtime environments with defense products can help answer fundamental security questions.

# Next steps: Am I a DevOp now?
The importance of learning DevOps through hands-on experience and experimentation with various tools and techniques is emphasised. It addresses misconceptions about DevOps, highlighting that it represents a mindset and collaborative approach rather than a specific job role. The concept of a T-shaped individual is discussed, which refers to someone who has deep expertise in one area while understanding a broader range of technical subjects. The video emphasises the diversity of DevOps practices across organisations, indicating that there is no universally correct approach, as it is dependent on the people and needs of the organisation.
