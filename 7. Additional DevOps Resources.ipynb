    "# Unicorns, horses, and donkeys, oh my\n",
    "The concept of DevOps can be applied to three groups: unicorns (startups), horses (enterprise IT), and donkeys (small teams with budgetary constraints). The best way to learn and connect with like-minded individuals is through attending conferences such as DevOpsDays, Velocity, and DevOps Enterprise Summit. There are also technology-specific events and DevOps-related meetups in many cities. "

    "# Navigating the series of tubes\n",
    "The internet is a valuable resource for finding DevOps information, but it can be challenging due to its fragmented nature. Twitter is the most active social network for DevOps. DevOps Weekly is an excellent weekly email newsletter curated by Gareth Rushgrove. DevOps.com, DZone, and InfoQ are generic tech aggregators with DevOps channels. DevOps Cafe, Arrested DevOps, and Food Fight are popular podcasts. Many blogs have valuable posts, including Kitchen Soap, IT Revolution Press, Dev2Ops, Continuous Delivery, Stochastic Resonance, More Than Seven, Agile Admin, and more. SlideShare, YouTube, and Vimeo have recordings of conferences and user group meetings."
