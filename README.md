# DevOps Course Notes

This repository contains my notes on the DevOps course by Ernest Mueller and James Wickett. The course provides a comprehensive overview of the DevOps movement, emphasising the core values of CAMS (culture, automation, measurement, and sharing) and its impact on modern business practices. It covers various methodologies, tools, and best practices that organisations can adopt to transition into DevOps, including agile and lean project management principles. The course also explores the integration of traditional concepts like ITIL, ITSM, and SDLC within the DevOps framework. Additionally, it discusses key aspects of DevOps such as infrastructure automation, continuous delivery, and reliability engineering.
