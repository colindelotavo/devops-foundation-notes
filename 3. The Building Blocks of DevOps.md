# DevOps building block: Agile
Agile originated from the Agile Manifesto in 2001, which emphasised collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. It evolved from the traditional software development approach called waterfall, which moves software through sequential stages from requirements gathering to development, testing, and release. In contrast, Agile is iterative and emphasises collaboration between workers and customers, with a focus on delivering working software in frequent feedback cycles. This approach reduces the risk of major problems emerging later in the development process, leading to better customer satisfaction (due to the implementation of the iterative feedback loops), increased productivity and faster time to market.

# DevOps building block: Lean
Lean is a systematic process for eliminating waste that was originally devised in the manufacturing world (Toyota in Japan) and later adapted to software development by Mary and Tom Poppendieck. Lean is a building block of DevOps and focuses on recognising activities that add value and eliminating those that do not. It has seven principles that apply to software and identifies three types of waste: muda (useless waste), muri (the major form of waste, though there is a necessary waste type, such as compliance), and mura (inconsistent waste). Lean techniques include Kaizen and value-stream mapping, and it has become an important part of successful DevOps implementations. 

# Agile versus Lean
- Agile's main goal is to deliver working software frequently and enable rapid adaptation to changing requirements. Agile values individuals and interactions, working solutions, customer collaboration, and being proactive in responding to change. <br/>
- Lean's main goal is to optimise processes, reduce waste, and maximise value for customers. Lean helps optimise the entire software development lifecycle by identifying and removing bottlenecks, reducing 'waste', and honing the flow of work. <br/>

# ITIL, ITSM, and the SDLC
ITIL - Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure Library <br>
ITSM - Information Technology (IT) Service Management <br>
SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle <br>

IT service management (ITSM) highlights the importance of service delivery throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), from design to retirement. ITIL, the pioneering ITSM framework, was initially developed by the UK government to manage services, and has since evolved into a widely adopted framework with multiple versions. Although ITIL provides guidance for various IT processes, it is often associated with a waterfall or push-driven model. Gene Kim, co-author of "The Visible Ops Handbook," demonstrates how ITIL can be implemented in a lightweight and agile manner. The main idea is to implement processes as necessary using a lean and agile mindsetâ€” without introducing 'waste' or bottlenecks, other practices that have been introduced previously should also be considered, such as how the processes impact or value to the customer, rather than implementing processes for the sake of standard IT practice.
